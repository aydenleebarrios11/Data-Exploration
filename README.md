# Data-Exploration
In this project, I used Python’s pandas library and dataFrames to analyze survey responses. This was one of my first data science projects, and I completed it independently. The guidelines were intentionally open ended and we were simply asked to explore any question that interested us. I chose to examine whether the respondent’s gender influenced how they answered scenarios in which gender was explicitly mentioned.
Using pandas made the analysis structured, efficient, and easy to iterate on. It allowed me to quickly extract and manipulate the data I needed. Through this project, I strengthened both my data analysis and data visualization skills while gaining experience formulating meaningful questions from raw survey data.
